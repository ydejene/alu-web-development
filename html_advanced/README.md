Advanced Semantic HTML Project: Smile School

This is a single-page web project built to practice and demonstrate an understanding of advanced semantic HTML principles. The goal was to translate a given Figma design into a robust, accessible, and structured HTML document, without relying on CSS or JavaScript. The page, titled "Smile School," serves as a promotional and informational site for a school that teaches people how to smile.

Features
This project focuses on the following core concepts of semantic HTML:

Semantic Elements: Using meaningful HTML5 tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <footer>, <figure>, and <figcaption> to define the structure and purpose of the content.

Accessible Images: Utilizing the alt attribute on all <img> tags to provide meaningful descriptions for screen readers and search engines.

Hierarchical Headings: Correctly using <h1> through <h6> tags to establish a clear content hierarchy, which is essential for both accessibility and SEO.

Lists & Tables: Structuring data with an appropriate list (<ul>, <ol> , <li>) 

Structured Content: The page is divided into specific, semantically-rich sections, including:

"Meet the Pros": A section featuring professional staff, each with an image and a short description.

Testimonial: A single, prominent testimonial to build trust and credibility.

Video Library: A section containing embedded videos, each with a corresponding rating.
